# Exploratory data analysis of ultrasound scans
For my capstone I am building computer vision algorithms to identify objects in ultrasound images. Because we want to be able to scan multiple areas I decided to see if I could make a statistical model to identify different scan locations so we could apply the correct machine learning algorithm autonomously. 
# Use
All exploration, data and results are documented in the `notebook.ipynb` file. 
## Package management
As long as your chosen python enviroment has *pip, ipython, and ipykernel*
then you can run the notebook. It will automatically install all other needed packages using pip by reading from the `requirements.txt` file
## Data Management
All data will be stored locally under a directory called `data/` and will be downloaded if not present automatically by the notebook
