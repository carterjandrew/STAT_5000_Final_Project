    "For my CSCI capstone project I am collaborating to develop a moible application that employes computer vision to preform object detection and ideally segmentation on ultrasound images. The objective is to help people in medically disparaged places use the powerful but difficult technology. Some of the limitations imposed on this project were the lack of readily availible electricity and modern computing hardware. Because of this our scope for model complexity is limited to reserve enery draw on phones.\n",

    "Deep covolutional neural networks, like we have chosen to employ, trade sphicsticated results for large computation time and lack of interpretability. While other methods of statistical analysis or machine learning would struggle to capsture the complexity of the data and underfit they have appeal because of their preformant nature. \n"
